5. Copy the code: Copy the Python code provided earlier and paste it into the random_number_searcher.py file in PyCharm.

6. Set the path to the WebDriver: Replace '/path/to/your/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe' in the code with the actual path to the Microsoft WebDriver executable that you downloaded earlier.

7. Run the code: Run the Python script by clicking the green play button next to the main() function definition, or right-clicking in the editor and selecting Run 'random_number_searcher'. This will execute the code, opening Edge browser and performing searches for random numbers in multiple tabs(range that you have defined for the for loop).
